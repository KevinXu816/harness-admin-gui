# Harness GUI

The Harness GUI is a Node.js REST Service and a React client. It will eventually perform all Harness Admin functions. It will be implemented in the following steps:

 * **v0.0.1 First Commit:** returns a list of Engine Instances from GET localhost:3000 as a JSON array.
 * **v0.1.0:** client and server. Inspection GUI for Engines with minimal client side GUI.
